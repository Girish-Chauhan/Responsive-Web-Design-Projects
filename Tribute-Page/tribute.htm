                <p><strong>Heir to a great tradition</strong> Bharatmata is writhing in anguish and pain over the loss.
                    No man loved Bharatmata and Indians more than Mahatma Gandhi. Let the tragedy that was enacted in
                    Delhi give the people of India the tune, reason, rhyme and melody for the history of their future. I
                    pray that the history of India might be written with the rhythm and tune of the grief that
                    Bharatmata had felt when Mahatma Gandhi fell.</p>
                <p>No one could die a more glorious death than Mahatma Gandhi. He was going to theseat of his prayer to
                    speak to his Rama. He did not die in a bed calling for hotwater, doctors or nurses. He did not die
                    after mumbling incoherent words in thesick bed. He died standing, not even sitting down. Rama was
                    too eager to take himeven before he could reach the seat of his prayer.</p>

                <p>When Socrates died for his views and Christ for his faith, they believed that they would not get
                    another example like that.</p>

                <h3>Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru</h3>
                <h4>Prime Minister</h4>
                <p><strong>This man of God trod the earth</strong> Great men and eminent men have monuments in bronze
                    and marble set up for them, but this man of divine fire managed in his life-time to become enmeshed
                    in millions and millions of hearts so that all of us became somewhat of the stuff that he was made
                    of, though to an infinitely lesser degree. He spread out over India not in palaces only, or in
                    select places, or in assemblies, but in every hamlet and hut of the lowly and those who suffer. He
                    lives in the hearts of millions and he will live for immemorial ages.</p>
                <p>...He has gone, and all over India $here is a feeling of having been left desolate and forlorn. All
                    of us sense that feeling, and I do not know when we shall be able to get rid of it, id yet together
                    with that feeling there is also a feeling of proud thanksgiving that it has been given to us of this
                    generation to be associated with this mighty person. In ages to come, centuries and may be
                    millenniums after us, people will think of this generation when this man of God trod the earth and
                    will think of us who, however small, could also follow his path and probably tread on that holy
                    ground where his feet had been. Let us be worthy of him. Let us always be so.</p>

                <p><strong>His supreme sacrifice will quicken our conscience</strong> For even though his mortal frame
                    will turn into ashes tomorrow, at 4 p.m., Gandhiji's imperishable teachings will abide with us. I
                    even feel that Gandhiji's immortal spirit is still hovering over us and will continue to watch over
                    the nation's destiny in future also. The mad youth who killed him was wrong if he thought thereby he
                    was destroying his noble mission. Perhaps God wanted Gandhiji's mission to fulfil and prosper
                    through his death.</p>
                <p>I am sure Gandhiji's supreme sacrifice will wake up the conscience of our countrymen and evoke a
                    higher response in the heart of every Indian. I hope and pray that it may be given to us to complete
                    Gandhiji's mission. At this solemn moment, no one of us can afford to waver or lose his or her
                    heart. Let us all stand united and bravely face the national disaster that has overtaken us. Let us
                    all solemnly pledge ourselves afresh to Gandhiji's teachings and ideals.</p>

                <p><strong>Carried burden of humanity on his frail shoulders</strong> Mahatma Gandhi has carried on his
                    frail shoulders a great deal of the burden of humanity and now it was for them to stand together and
                    share it. If millions of Indians could divide that burden and carry it successfully, it would be
                    nothing short of a miracle.</p>

                <p><strong>Undying influence</strong> The light that illumined our motherland and indeed the world
                    amidst darkness and sorrow has suddenly gone out. The passing away of Mahatma Gandhi is the most
                    stunning blow that could fall on India. That he who had made India free and self-reliant, a friend
                    of all and enemy of none, loved and respected by millions, should fall at the hands of an assassin,
                    one of his own community and countrymen, is a matter of the deepest shame and tragedy. He is of
                    those whose influence never dies and indeed shines more and more with the passage of time.</p>
                <p>The shot of the assassin not only vitally pierced through his mortal body but has grievously struck
                    the very heart of Humanism and India, which could survive only if people resolutely decide to make
                    the pursuit of such methods impossible</p>

                <h4>Health Minister</h4>
                <p><strong>He stood between us and disaster</strong> It is impossible to estimate his loss at this
                    critical juncture in our history. I am sure that we shall miss his wise counsel more and more as the
                    days pass by. He has led us faultlessly to our goal of political independence. The communal strife
                    that started almost immediately after August 15 wounded him to the depths. An India wedded to
                    violence he could not tolerate.</p>
                <p>He saw the moral deterioration in us and, as a loving father, he again unwearyingly pointed out to us
                    the right way. With his infinite love he was trying to quench the anger that raged in many breasts.
                    He was the one thing that stood between us and disaster, for lawlessness and disorder and hate and
                    violence can lead nowhere else.</p>

                    Hinduism of this evil and to remove this blot from its face.</p>

                <p><strong>Gave his country its freedom and its flag</strong> Mahatma Gandhi, whose frail body was
                    committed to the flames yesterday, is not dead. It was right that the cremation took place in the
                    midst of the dead kings who were buried in Delhi, for he was the kingliest of all kings. It is right
                    also that he who was the Apostle of Peace should have been taken to the cremation ground with all
                    the honours of a great warrior. Far greater than all warriors who led armies to battle was this
                    little man, the bravest, the most tried friend of all. Delhi has become the centre and the sanctuary
                    of the great revolution- ary who emancipated his enslaved country from foreign bondage and gave to
                    it its freedom and its flag.</p>
